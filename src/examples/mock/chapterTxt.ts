	"THE   ROME CITY   GUIDE   3  © Netplan - Internet solutions for tourism THE   ROME CITY   GUIDE 4  © Netplan - Internet solutions for tourism was famous for some work, conquest or edict. Under   Traianus ,   the   empire   enjoyed   its period of maximum expansion and reached as far as ruling land that stretched from the Danube to the Nile. With   the   passing   of   the   years,   the   city became   increasingly   Christian,   while   the empire fell into a fatal period of difficulty. The Pope became more and more powerful, building the grounds for the birth of the   Holy Roman Empire   (800 A.D.), which gave rise to the coronation of Charlemagne by the Pope. The Church’s power continued to increase and   Rome   became   the   representation   of this   power   on   earth.   Between   1300   and 1600, many   churches   were built, beautifully painted with frescoes by Renaissance artists such as Raffaello and Michelangelo. Crowds of pilgrims flocked to the Eternal City from all   over   the   world   to   admire   its   Baroque squares , its fountains and its monumental basilicas. After   the   patriotic   unrest   that   started   in 1848 and which was headed by   Garibaldi , a plebiscite approved the annexing of Rome to the   Kingdom of Italy   in 1870, which set up its official center in the city soon after. Starting   from   1920,   Rome   was   shaken   by the terrible rise to power of Fascism that culminated in the pact made between the Italian Government and Nazi Germany. After Italy was liberated by the Allies during the Second World War, a referendum held on June 2nd 1946 sanctioned the end of the monarchy and the beginning of the   Republic .  ",
	"The   founding of Rome   is enveloped in myth: the story goes that the first city center sprang up in 753 B.C. on the Palatine hill, built by Romulus after he had killed his twin brother Remus. Romulus   was   the   first   of   the   seven   kings of   Rome ,   who   started   off   the   basic characteristics of this city that would go on to make Rome powerful throughout the ancient world:   public   works,   institutional   reforms, aqueducts. With   the   arrival   of   the   Republic,   Rome increased its expansion policy and after the  Punic Wars , Carthage, Corsica and Sardinia were all annexed to the Republic. The   end   of   the   Republic   determined   the beginning of Silla’s dictatorship (82 B.C.) The dictator Caius Julius Caesar oversaw a period of heavy expansion overseas. He was assassinated in 44 B.C. The   Emperor   Octavius   Augustus   brought Rome to its “golden era”: a lengthy period of peace and stability, which was celebrated with monumental   works of art . Many emperors came after him, each of whom  History and culture  Rome : Coliseum chapel’s vaulted ceiling: about 1000 square meters.   He   painted   frescoes   representing stories from the Bible such as the amazing Universal Judgment, which caused a scandal because of the nudity of about four hundred people in it, and the Creation of Mankind.  San Giovanni in Laterano  This   is   the   Cathedral   of   Rome,   the   most important church after St. Peter’s. The first church was built in 314, when the Emperor Constantine gave the land to the Pope. The current building complex is made up of the Church, the Baptistery, Palazzo Lateranense, the   Scala   Santa   and   the   Hospital   of   San Giovanni.  San Paolo fuori le mura  This   church   is   in   Via   Ostiense   and   was founded in 330. It was only finished, however, in the 5th century. The Church was built on the wishes of Constantine, who wished to commemorate   the   Deacon   Lorenzo,   who became a martyr together with Pope Sixtus II in the middle of the 3rd century, with a magnificent tomb.  Santa Maria Maggiore  This church stands on the Esquilino hill and is the first Roman church to be named after the Holy Virgin. Its bell tower is the highest in Rome. There is a story that this was the site where fragments of wood from Jesus’ crib were kept. For this reason, the church was called Santa Maria ad Praesepe for a certain period of time.  The   museums   and   galleries   that   can’t   be missed:  The Vatican Museums  This group of museums is divided into several sections such as the Egyptian Museum, the Ethnological   Museum,   the   Painting   Gallery and the Raffaello Rooms to name a few. As well   as   the   ancient   artifacts,   the   Vatican Museums contain hundreds of works of art ",
	"The most spectacular churches in the Eternal City:  St. Peter’s Basilica  A   huge   sanctuary   of   Christian   religion.   Its façade is 45 meters high, and its enormous dome is 136 meters. St. Peter’s Basilica, the largest   church   in   the   world,   overlooks   the square that carries the same name that was designed by Bernini and which is surrounded by a colonnade. Grandeur and majesty: this is the sensation that one gets walking up Via della Conciliazione towards Piazza San Pietro. One of the most important works of art inside is the “Pietà” sculpture by Michelangelo, that was created between 1498 and 1500.  The Sistine Chapel  This chapel owes its name to Sixtus IV, the Pope who commissioned the building of the chapel at the end of the 14th century. The Chapel was decorated by famous 15th century painters such as Botticelli and il Ghirlandaio. Later, in the 16th century, Michelangelo was called upon to paint all the frescoes on the  Churches and Museums  Rome : Basilica di San Pietro/ THINGS TO SEE   / THINGS TO SEE THE   ROME CITY   GUIDE   5  © Netplan - Internet solutions for tourism THE   ROME CITY   GUIDE 6  © Netplan - Internet solutions for tourism commissioned and collected by the Popes over the centuries and created by the most famous artists in history. The statue of Laocoonte in the courtyard of Palazzo del Belvedere is not to be missed.  The Capitoline Museums  This museum, founded in 1471, houses findings and works of art that tell the full history of Rome, from the antique sculptures and bas- reliefs portraying the acts of the emperors to the paintings on show in the Picture Gallery.  Galleria Borghese  This is one of the largest collections in the world. The collection was begun in 1600 by the   Borghese   family;   it   was   plundered   by Napoleon at the beginning of the 19th century and then partly recompiled once more and was acquired by the State at the beginning of the 20th century. There are many works of art by painters and sculptors to see: Amor sacro e Amor Profano by Tiziano, la Pietà by Rubens, Davide con la testa di Golia by Caravaggio, Apollo e Dafne, David and Pluto e Prosperina by Bernini.  the games, such as how to make the ferocious beasts   appear   unexpectedly   in   the   arena, bringing them up to the main area with an elevator hoist that was hidden in the sand. In 438, the games were prohibited and the Coliseum was gradually abandoned.  Roman Forum  The Roman Forum was built in the 6th century B.C. on marshland that was drained by the creation of a sewer and drainage network. It rapidly became the center of social and political   life   in   Ancient   Rome,   and   new palaces, statues, temples and courts were added   to   the   area   century   after   century. From   Via   Salaria   (parallel   to   Via   dei   Fori Imperiali) it is possible to enter this amazing archeological   site,   which   is   almost   a   city within a city.  Circus Maximus  This   enormous   structure   was   used   for entertainment events such as the gripping chariot races that were a huge favorite of the Roman people. The area could hold up to 230,000 spectators and is one of the oldest areas in Rome.  Domus Aurea  This structure was built on the ashes of a terrible fire that destroyed a large part of Rome in 64 A.D. Domus Aurea was built on the wishes of Nero, who was also probably responsible for the fire. During one of his famous ravings of omnipotence, the prince wanted   a   more   majestic   Rome   with   his enormous, new residence as the center of this newly-styled city. Inside this new palace there   were   buildings,   gardens   and   a   lake called “Stagnum Neronis”. The palace was disproportionately large, but was in perfect harmony with the 35-meter high bronze statue of the prince that was sculpted and placed at the entrance to the Domus Aurea. The Domus Aurea has recently been   opened   to   the   public   after   years   of restoration work.  ",
	"The greatest historical architecture from the Roman Empire:  Coliseum  This   is   the   most   ancient   monument   from ancient   Rome.   Its   building   began   in   7.5. A.D. and was opened in 80 A.D., an opening celebrated with a full day of bloody games during   which,   according   to   legend,   five thousand animals were killed. This was a gruesome leisure activity for the ancient   Romans:   prisoners   condemned   to death were torn to pieces by ferocious beasts, animals were killed by archers and there were fights to the death between “professional” gladiators. The surface area of the Coliseum, which totals about   19,000   square   meters,   was   arranged into four sections, each of which could hold up to 70,000 spectators. The Emperor’s box was placed in the center from where he could decide the gladiators’ fate with a simple hand gesture. The underground area of the Coliseum was used to organize and create the settings for  Monuments  ",
	"Rome:   Castel Sant’Angelo and Ponte Sant’AngeloTHE   ROME CITY   GUIDE   7  © Netplan - Internet solutions for tourism  THE   ROME CITY   GUIDE 8  © Netplan - Internet solutions for tourism  Pantheon  This is one of the best-preserved buildings that date back to ancient Rome. This building dates back to 27 B.C., but was partly destroyed and then rebuilt between 118 and 125 A.D. It later became a Christian place of worship where the   tombs   of   Raffaello,   Vittorio   Emanuele II, Umberto I are still kept, The huge dome and the fine marble decorations inside the Pantheon are worthy of note.  Castel Sant’Angelo  The   original   building,   dating   back   to   123 A.D., was very different from the one that stands on the site today. Around 1200, Castel Sant’Angelo   became   the   property   of   the Vatican and a sort of fortified corridor was built to connect the building with the Vatican Palaces.  Catacombs  The catacombs were the places where the early   Christians   celebrated   funerals   and where they were buried when they died. The catacombs, the oldest of which dates back to the 2nd century, were built outside the city walls.  Terme di Caracalla  These   were   the   most   luxurious   and sophisticated   thermal   spa   baths   in   ancient Rome. They were built using the finest marble and had a sophisticated plumbing system that supplied the baths with hot water. It is still possible to imagine the original splendor of this place when we visit what is left of the site today.  such as the Fontana dei Fiumi by Bernini, which is the base of the Egyptian obelisk in the   center;   Palazzo   Pamphili   and   Fontana del Moro.  Piazza Venezia  This   square   was   named   in   honor   of   the Republic   of   Venice   that   opened   up   its embassy in this very square. Piazza Venezia was   unfortunately   made   famous   when   it became the stage for Mussolini’s speeches that   he   pronounced   from   the   balcony   of Palazzo Venezia, an imposing building that dates back to the second half of the 15th century. The Vittoriano, dedicated to Vittorio Emanuele II, is another important building.  Piazza del Popolo  This   square   is   located   at   the   top   of   the triangle that is formed by three long streets: the central one is the famous Via del Corso. At the center of the square there is an obelisk that was brought to Rome by the Emperor Augustus   after   he   conquered   Egypt.   The magnificent Porta del Popolo has two identical neoclassical buildings on each side of it.  Campidoglio  This   hill   next   to   Piazza   Venezia   has   been a seat of government since ancient times: religious ceremonies and political discussions took place in the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitol   Hill.   Today   the   Rome   City   Council meets   in   Palazzo   Senatorio,   a   wonderful example   of   Renaissance   architecture.   The square, which is dominated by the Capitoline Museum, and the “Cordonata” staircase were both designed by Michelangelo in the 16th century.  Trevi Fountain  The most majestic in Rome, and the most famous   throughout   the   world.   The   Trevi Fountain   dominates   a   small   square   in   the heart   of   Rome   and   entered   everyone’s imagination thanks to the nighttime bathing scene   with   Anita   Ekberg   in   the   film   “La ",
	"All the city’s squares to admire:  Piazza di Spagna  This is maybe the most charming square in the city. Its unique shape, that narrows in the middle, reminds us of a butterfly. The square’s name comes from the fact that the Spanish Embassy stood in the square in the 17th century. The square is permanently full of tourists and as far back as 1600 it was the favorite place for visitors to Rome from all over the world. The steps that connect the Church of Trinità dei Monti to Piazza di Spagna are amazing, a mixture of curves, straight line and terraces, where it is possible to see the house of poets such as Keats and Shelley (Keats-Shelley Memorial, info: 066784235).  Piazza Navona  This is a truly wonderful square to see. It has an unusual, elongated oval shape that is the same as that of the ancient Domiziano Stadium over which the square was built. The predominating style is Baroque and there are so many monuments and buildings to admire  Squares and fountains  ",

This   huge   Baroque construction, inspired by sea mythology, took 30 years to built, starting in 1732, and was started by Niccolò Salvi who did not live to see the completion of his work. Legend says that anyone who throws a coin into the fountain will return to the Eternal City.  Fontana del Tritone  Built   by   Bernini,   this   fountain   is   in   Piazza Barberini   and   was   commissioned   by   the Barberini family in 1642. The fountain shows Triton who is blowing into a shell while four dolphins hold him up.  Fontana della Barcaccia  This fountain is in Piazza di Spagna, at the foot of the Spanish Steps ( Scalinata di Trinità dei Monti ) and was built in 1629 by Bernini. The structure is reminiscent of a boat sunk by water, in remembrance of the Tiber flood that hit Rome in 1598.  Fontana dei Fiumi  This fountain is in the center of Piazza Navona. It was designed by Bernini for Pope Innocent X. One of the many obelisks that can be seen in Rome has been placed on top of the fountain. The four giants sculpted around the fountain base represent four rivers: the Ganges, the Danube, the Nile and Rio della Plata.  / THINGS TO SEE   / THINGS TO SEE  Palazzo Chigi  This palace was bought by the Chigi family, an aristocratic, Roman family, in 1659, and it was furnished with their private collection of furniture and works of art that can still be seen in its rooms. At the beginning of the 20th century the palace was sold to the Italian State and it has been the seat of the Council of Ministers since 1961.  Palazzo Madama  This palace dates back to the 15th century. It was turned into a luxurious residence by Pope Leo X, who belonged to the powerful De Medici family. The palace still contains a huge library and several works of art. It became the House of the Italian Senate in 1871.  The wonderful Villas and luxuriant gardens in Rome, magical places for romantic walks:  Villa Borghese  This is the largest public park and the favorite of the Roman people. This park covers eighty hectares and contains buildings, sculptures, fountains and one of the most interesting collections   of   all,   the   one   inside   Galleria Borghese, which was recently reopened to the public. Villa Borghese was built around 1600 following the wishes of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, who bought the land surrounding the first central part, which already belonged to the Borghese family. At the end of the 18th century, the park was enriched even further by the building of the “Giardino del Lago”: a small island with luxuriant vegetation on which a temple was built.  Villa Pamphilj  Due   to   its   position   and   the   particularly favorable climate in this area, this park was named “Villa Belrespiro”. This wonderful villa was first built in 1644 on a huge piece of land just outside the center of Rome. Now those beautiful gardens, full of animated fountains are just a memory: around 1800 a large part ",
	"The magnificent Palaces of the Republic that were once the residences of Popes and kings:  Palazzo del Quirinale  This has been the President of the Republic’s residence since 1948. In the past it was used as   the   summer   residence   for   Popes   who had the Cappella Paolina and the Cappella dell’Annunziata chapels built inside it. In 1871, it became the residence of the Savoia dynasty   and   it   was   completely   renovated. The East wing of the Palace was called the Sabauda Wing. The palace’s wonderful outdoor gardens that lie on four hectares of land are full of tree- lined avenues, fountains and rare plants.  Palazzo Montecitorio  Around 1600, Pope Innocent X commissioned the project for this palace by Bernini. It   then   became   the   courts   of   Rome   and since 1870 it has been the Lower House of Parliament. Inside the building there are several antique and modern works of art.

Let’s take a look at food and wine you can buy. Every morning in the picturesque market in  Campo de’ Fiori , fruit and vegetable stalls show   off   their   seasonal   wares:   the   effect you get is an explosion of color and aromas that makes your mouth water. The bakers’ shops and food shops surrounding the square are also culprits in stirring up this desire for food. For   good   wine   lovers,   many   wine   cellars  in   the   city   organize   wine   tasting   courses and   information-giving   meetings   about vineyards, harvesting, fermentation and all the processes linked to the production of this nectar of the gods. Among some of the places in the city that organize such events, we can name “La Tradizione” and “Franchi”. The   historical coffee shops   in the city are our   last   stop   in   this   section,   where   it   is possible to try typical Roman food in unique surroundings   that   combine   culture,   history and   tradition.

For   espresso   coffee-lovers,   we recommend Caffè Sant’Eustachio located in the square with the same name, a fine coffee shop founded in the 1930s where the coffee is roasted by hand over wood fires.

	"Simple,   with   strong   flavors,   overflowing with dressings and anything but low-calorie. Perhaps a little unrefined but this contributes to   its   authentic,   genuine   style.   Traditional Roman cooking is made up of simple, meager ingredients, that follow the seasons and which are therefore extremely fresh. A   typical   Roman   menu   begins   with   the essential   bruschetta   “ammazzavampiri” (so   full   of   garlic   it   would   kill   vampires), and maybe also a wonderful   mozzarella in carrozza . The large pasta course that follows could be:   spaghetti alla carbonara ,   bucatini all’amatriciana ,   bucatini   cacio   e   pepe   or gnocchi   alla   romana .   If   you   want   to   try rigatoni pasta with the famous pajata sauce, we recommend that first you eat it and then ask what the ingredients are: you might be so shocked that you no longer want to try the dish otherwise and lose your chance to try out new types of food.

	"Rome is, together with Milan, the city where most   cultural   events   such   as   exhibitions, concerts and shows take place in Italy. Our  guide   to   Rome   suggests   a   list   of   regular events that take place in the city each year. Keep in mind the fact that if you want to plan a trip to Rome in a period when one of these events is taking place, you should book a   hotel in Rome   well in advance.  Roma Europa Festival ,   September-October  This has been an annual appointment since 1986 for modern art and theatre, music and dance,   with   artists   from   all   over   Europe appearing.  Festival Romics ,   October  The Comics and Cartoon Festival: exhibitions, cartoon   film   showings   and   meeting   with the   most   famous   designers   and   publishing companies.  Roma Jazz Festival ,   October  This annual festival totally dedicated to jazz music was organized for the first time in 1876.  Events  ",
	"Rome : fashion in Piazza di Spagna / THINGS TO EXPERIENCE   / THINGS TO EXPERIENCE lovers.   In   Via   della   Pace,   near   to   Piazza Navona,   there   is   the   famous Antico   Caffè della Pace, which has been a daytime and night-time meeting place for intellectuals, artists and famous names for many years. Campo de’ Fiori is one of the busiest places in Rome: in the morning it is full of the   market  stalls and in the evening it is invaded by hundreds of young people who meet up in the numerous wine bars and bars around the square. If instead you are looking for real night clubs, Rome has no end of them. Here are few of the most popular:   Gilda , loved by politicians and showbiz stars;   Goa , electronic music and art exhibitions,   Ex magazzini   and   Black out rock club   for live music. ",
	"If   you   walk   along   Via   Veneto   you   realize immediately   that   today’s   reality   is   far removed from the image the Fellini engraved in everyone’s memory with his famous film “La   Dolce   Vita”.   Via   Veneto   is   completely different   to   the   glorious   years   of   the   50s and 60s. There are no longer actors or exiled monarchs sitting at the coffee shop tables, besieged by paparazzi. You may perhaps still find a few out-of-date tourists. The spirit of “la Dolce Vita” has moved with the   times,   no   longer   aimed   at   the   bored, decadent aristocracy but to a large group of mildly unconventional night people that want to have a good time, communicate and relax. This   is   a   self-gratifying   and   slightly irresponsible attitude that has invaded the narrow streets of   Trastevere . Trastevere is an   extremely   lively   area   of   town:   walking along the labyrinth of alleys and lanes, among coffee shops, restaurants, pubs and clubs with live music, all brimming over with life is a unique and exciting experience. The areas around   Via della Pace   and   Campo de’ Fiori   are also interesting for night life  La Dolce Vita  Rome : Bar SettimianoTHE   ROME CITY   GUIDE   17  © Netplan - Internet solutions for tourism  THE   ROME CITY   GUIDE 18  © Netplan - Internet solutions for tourism  to visiting the Vatican, a real city within a city.   We   recommend   that   you   begin   your tour   in   the   early   morning,   to   avoid   the huge queues that form at a certain time of the morning outside the Vatican Museums. Remember that you have about three hours available if you want to stick to the itinerary; don’t miss the visit to the   Sistine Chapel , that is so splendidly covered in frescoes by Michelangelo. Next, head off to St Peter’s Square   where   you   can   see   Saint   Peter’s Cathedral , the largest church in the world. Leaving the Cathedral behind you, walk along Via della Conciliazione until you get to   Castel Sant’Angelo   where Hadrian’s Mausoleum is kept. Then go on to Piazza Navona by tram or taxi for lunch. One bit of advice: don’t eat tripe or anything similar if you want to avoid falling asleep on the edge of a fountain in the middle of the afternoon itinerary. You will be able to satisfy all your mad urges for eating whatever you want at dinnertime.  Afternoon  After getting to know Rome as the “city of faith” this is the moment to explore Rome “Caput   Mundi”   in   all   its   ancient   beauty. Let’s start off with the Pantheon, not far from   Piazza   Navona,   a   pagan   temple   that was transformed into a church in 608. From the Pantheon go straight to the   Coliseum , the huge amphitheater that is the symbol of   Rome.   Once   you   have   finished   visiting the   inside   of   the   Coliseum,   head   towards the   Roman   Forum ,   walking   along   Via   dei Fori Imperiali. If you still have time you can choose between a visit to the Palatine hill, the first center of this city and home to many emperors or to the   Circus Maximus   or the  Domus Area .  Evening  Trastevere is the ideal place to savor the true essence of Roman nightlife. Join the crowds walking along the alleyways and stop off in a few of the typical coffee shops that are crowded with people. ",
	"If you are busy and in a hurry, but you don’t want to miss out on the pleasures of life, here is the   Rome itinerary   that is just right for you. A full weekend dedicated to discovering this amazing city. Only a part discovery (you just won’t be able to see it all) but just as “hard”, due to the route you will follow that is mostly on foot. Remember to wear comfortable shoes and if it is summertime, bring a hat to protect you from the sun that is very strong here. You won’t need a water flask as there are so many coffee shops and   restaurants in Rome   where you can quench your thirst.  DAY 1  If you can, we advise you to arrive the evening before, booking one of the   hotels in Rome   a little in advance. In this way you will have the whole morning available for the itinerary and you will be well rested to face the hard day ahead.  Morning  This part of the day will be entirely dedicated  A weekend full of experiences  ",
	"DAY 2  Morning  Try to wake up early, but not too early: today’s itinerary is tough too, so it’s better to begin the day a bit later rather than being worn out in the afternoon. As   a   first   stop,   we   suggest   the   famous, spectacular   Trevi   Fountain :   allow   yourself to join in the obligatory ritual for any decent tourist of throwing a coin into the fountain. Then go on to   Piazza di Spagna   by taxi or tram and admire the fantastic   Spanish Steps . From here you can have a rest from all this culture by taking a walk down the elegant  Via Condotti   to admire the luxurious shop windows. If you are feeling more Bohemian than fashion victim, why not take a walk down  Via Margutta , the famous street of artists. The last stop this morning is the magnificent  Piazza   del   Popolo .   Choose   one   of   the  restaurants in Rome   nearby and have a bite to eat.  Afternoon  Your afternoon will be dedicated to visiting  Villa Borghese   and the splendid   Gallery   of the same name. You can also have coffee in the   picturesque   Casina   Valadier   and   then towards sunset, you can enjoy the splendid view of Rome from the panoramic terrace of the   Pincio .  Evening  Time for a quick dinner and then it is time to leave. Unless, of course, you don’t want to stay longer and call the hotel in Rome that you chose and book another night in the Eternal City.

There were various temples dedicated to the various “foreign” divinities that were uncovered   during   archeological   digs.   Ostia Antica   was   rediscovered   fairly   recently   in historical   terms:   digs   began   around   1800 and are still continuing today.   Piazza delle Corporazioni , with its floors entirely made up of mosaics, and that was once home to the offices of the “trade representatives” of ancient times, is an interesting site to see. From the steps of the Theater, that is still used during the summer season for shows, there is a wonderful view of the area.  Tivoli  Tivoli   (about   20   km   from   Rome),   which was   used   by   the   Romans   as   a   holiday resort in ancient times too, is famous for its   magnificent   villas.   One   of   the   most spectacular   is   Villa   Adriana   that   became the residence of the Emperor Hadrian when he   retired   from   political   life.   This   is   the place   where   Hadrian   wanted   to   recreate the wonders of the world that he had seen during his travels. For this reason, spread out over the one hundred hectares of parkland, there   are   groups   of   buildings   that   remind us   of   Greek   constructions,   such   as   the reproduction   of   the   Athens   Academia   and Egyptian buildings such as the reproduction of the city of Canopus.

As always, our   tourist’s guide to Rome   and surrounding areas has tried to group together the   places   to   see   into   various   sections   of interest, trying to satisfy everyone’s tastes:  Ostia Antica  ",
	"Ostia Antica was founded in the 4th century B.C. For a long time it was Rome’s only river port: once upon a time, the Tiber ended its course in this very town, whose name actually means   “mouth”,   before   flowing   into   the Tyrrhenian Sea. Ostia was a cosmopolitan city and essential from   a   military   and   commercial   point   of  Trips outside the city’s gates, from Ostia to Frascati  visitors: Frascati, about 20 km from Rome.

One   of   the   few “independent” designers: Capucci detached himself from the traditional fashion circuits and personally organized the presentations of his collections almost as if they were art exhibitions. In 1995 he exhibited his designs at the Biennale in Venice.  Fernanda Gattinoni   – She opened her Rome atelier in 1945 near Via Veneto. Her clothes were worn by famous people such as Anna Magnani,   Evita   Peron,   Ingrid   Bergman   and Audrey Hepburn.  Lancetti   – Roman by adoption, he opened his first atelier in Via Margutta, the famous street of artists. This was almost an omen of his fame as a designer-painter that he later obtained.  Valentino   - Valentino opened his first atelier in Rome in Via Condotti, and hit success after a fashion show at Pitti Immagine in Florence.

	"This short compendium of Roman shopping is for all shopping lovers. A compendium for all tastes, from high fashion chic to the cheap items on the market stalls, and with a mention of the new frontier of shopping, halfway between chic and cheap: outlets. Remember that if you want to go   shopping in Rome , you will need a bit of time time, so book a few nights extra in the   hotel in Rome  that you are staying in.  Roman labels: from Sorelle Fontana to Gai Mattiolo  Many famous names in Made in Italy fashion from   Rome   and   elsewhere   started   their careers in this city, often opening an atelier that soon began to attract the curiosity of aristocrats, politicians and film stars who then made them famous.  ",
	"Sorelle   Fontana   –   a   historical   label   that dressed   the   Roman   upper   middle   classes in the post-war period until the Dolce Vita era and then went on to the United States  Shopping in Rome  Rome : Porta Portese  Battistoni   – A historical, male tailors’ atelier in Rome, which was a favorite of the Duke of Windsor.  Gai Mattiolo   – Born in 1968 in Roma, he began his career as a fashion designer very early and is now one of the most popular “young” names in fashion.  Famous names outside the city: the outlets  Let’s   ignore   the   single-label   outlets   that spring up here and there in the province and let’s concentrate on the new   McArthurGlen Designer Outlet   in Castel Romano: a kind of consumer orgy concentrated in 20,000 square meters. This huge shopping city, 25 km south of Rome, was opened on October 9th 2003. We will bet that after a day spent here, even the   most   hardened   consumer   will   feel   the need to have a rest from shopping for at least a month! The Castel Romano outlet center has 95 shops including the famous labels (Etro, D&G, F.lli Rossetti,   Moreschi,   Mariella   Burani,   Calvin Klein, La Perla), younger brands (North Sails, Mandarina Duck, Liu-jo, Guess, Diesel, Levi’s, Stefanel, Tommy Hilfiger) and manufacturers of   various   accessories   (Lagostina,   Bassetti, Samsonite). Go there, choose, buy and take it for granted that   you   will   have   a   strange   feeling   in your stomach for a few days. Don’t worry: whenever you go to places like this, post- consumer guilt is normal!  Markets and flea markets: visiting the stalls looking for a bargain  For the more alternative consumers who snob the   artificial   lights   of   shopping   malls   and those who are attracted by the idea of owning something   that   is   out   of   the   ordinary,   we recommend a visit to the Roman flea markets. Get rid of the concept “in a hurry” from your minds for a while and take all the time you want: rummaging among the stalls requires considerable concentration. Your efforts will most definitely be worth it though: from the bottom of the stall, the bargain of a lifetime or a valuable item could crop up, or even just the issue of Tex Willer that you were really fond of but that you lost during your last house move.  Porta   Portese   that   veiled   air   of   illegality that it inherited from its origins still persists: during the Second World War, this was the city’s black market. Today you can find old furniture,   clothes,   records,   books,   plants, CDs and a lot more too (Via Portuense and Via Ippolito Nievo, every Sunday). The   Mercato delle Stampe   will literally drive fans crazy; magazines, prints and old books (Largo della Fontanella di Borghese, every morning except Sunday). Finally, if you are looking for vintage clothes or just second-hand clothes, you have to go to the market at   Via Sannio   (Via Sannio, every morning from Monday to Saturday).THE   ROME CITY   GUIDE   25  © Netplan - Internet solutions for tourism  THE   ROME CITY   GUIDE 26  © Netplan - Internet solutions for tourism  Hotels & Lodging  1 One Stars Hotels - 2 Two Stars Hotels...
